In this repository, I will learn about FastAPI as a web framework and how it works in interacting with backend databases. I will learn about schema validation, API endpoints and routes,
CRUD operations, database connections with sql, ORM, user authentication and more. I wish to demonstrate my learning journey through continous integration of code from my local repo into
this github repository. I hope to learn alot, and to apply my newly acquired skills into projects and reusable code in the future.
