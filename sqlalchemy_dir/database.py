"""
ORM object relational mapper is responsible for communicating
between the fastapi app and the database. This allows us to use an
SDK to use python code for communicating with the database. It
offers cross-database compatibility, relatively simple querying
logic and fast deployment.

"""
Define and build models and tables in python instead of having to create the tables
in Postgres for example. This is done using Classes and entries
through objects.
